# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Usually the estimate accuracy was right within around 5-10mins of the actual time

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

The estimate accuracy definitely improved over the course of the practicals as I got 
better at evaluating the requirements of a task. The overall time it took to complete each week's practicals
also decreased as I got better at coding.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Doing these estimates allowed me to evaluate how my coding ability was changing each week - generally improving
as I got faster at doing the tasks. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed by other people allowed me to see different approaches to tasks and also gave valuable
insight into areas or practices that I could improve on.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Similar to having my own code reviewed, reviewing other people's code has given me insight into different
ways of doing certain tasks.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 5 Code Review](https://github.com/thaisonk/cp1404practicals/pull/1#pullrequestreview-3416326197)

### Explanation

In this code review, the pull request asked for feedback on code structure, function use, and formatting. In the review,
I identified a few instances of incorrect formatting (line gaps and docstrings) something I had also identified myself
as needing to improve on. I also made a comment about breaking the code up into more single responsibility functions.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 6 Code Review](https://github.com/prabJCU/cp1404practicals/pull/2#pullrequestreview-3439946210)

### Explanation

In this code review, I identified some potential improvements regarding function usage and variable names. I also made
some positive comments regarding my fellow student's use of docstrings, formatting, and function naming.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

There is not a lot I would change about the practicals except maybe for practical 7 - the project management task was
massive and felt nearly on par with assignment 1. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I did really well on using the practicals to improve my coding ability and then implementing the things I'd done in the 
practicals into my assignments.
